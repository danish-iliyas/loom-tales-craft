                  Loom Tales began with a simple belief: every carpet and shawl carries within it the stories 
                  of countless hands, generations of knowledge, and irreplaceable cultural heritage. What started 
                  as a small family workshop has grown into a trusted name in premium textile care.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For over three decades, we've dedicated ourselves to mastering the delicate art of carpet and 
                  shawl restoration. Our team of master craftsmen combines time-honored techniques passed down 
                  through generations with modern conservation methods to provide unparalleled care for your 
                  precious textiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We understand that the carpets and shawls entrusted to us are more than mere objectsâ€”they're 
                  family heirlooms, artistic treasures, and tangible connections to cultural traditions. This 
                  understanding guides every decision we make and every service we provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, Loom Tales stands as a bridge between past and present, ensuring that the artistry of 
                  traditional textile craft continues to inspire and beautify homes for generations to come.
